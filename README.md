# YieldDrift: Redefining Stable Yield Through AVS-Driven Capital Allocation

📌 **Introduction**  
YieldDrift is a stablecoin-backed platform designed to optimize capital productivity for users. By enabling users to deposit stable assets, YieldDrift leverages an AVS (Automated Vault Selector) system to allocate funds to vetted investment managers. These managers generate returns through diverse strategies, while users retain the ability to withdraw their funds at any time.

With a seamless experience and trustless architecture, YieldDrift bridges the gap between traditional fund management and decentralized finance.
